**Implementation Decisions:**

Frontend Libraries and Frameworks:
1. React: I chose React as the frontend framework due to its popularity, ease of use, and extensive community support. React's component-based architecture allows for building modular and reusable UI components, making the application development process more efficient.

2. React Router: For handling client-side routing, I used React Router. It provides declarative routing, allowing me to define routes and map them to specific components, making navigation between different views seamless.

3. Axios: To handle API requests, I opted for Axios, a widely-used HTTP client library. Axios simplifies making asynchronous requests, handling responses, and managing error handling.

4. Ant Design: For UI components and styling, I chose Ant Design. It provides a set of well-designed and customizable components that enhance the overall look and feel of the application.

5. React DnD: To implement drag-and-drop functionality, I used React DnD. This library facilitates easy drag-and-drop interactions between components, allowing users to rearrange elements intuitively.

6. Socket.IO Client: For real-time updates, I implemented a WebSocket connection using Socket.IO client. This enables instant synchronization of data across connected clients when changes occur.

**Design Patterns:**
1. Component-based Architecture: I followed the component-based design pattern of React, where UI elements are organized into reusable and independent components. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and a modular approach to development.

2. Container-View Pattern: I used the container-view pattern to separate logic (containers) from presentation (views). Containers handle data fetching, state management, and business logic, while views focus on rendering UI components based on the provided data.
